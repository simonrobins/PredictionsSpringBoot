Predictions - Spring Boot

This is a little web application to allow people
to predict the results of Premier League matches
over a season.

I used it to teach myself some Spring Boot.

It is self-contained so you should be able to
download, unpack and import the project into Visual Studio,
and then run './gradlew bootRun'.
